Announcing Conference Talks and a Party for Write the Docs EU
=============================================================

Things are coming along nicely for our `EU conference`_.
The conference is 45 days away,
and we are putting together the final touches.

Today we are proud to announce the talks and party for Write the Docs EU.

Talks
-----

Talks are the main event of the conference. 
We are really excited about the quality and scope of the talks this year. 
There will be a little bit for everyone, 
and we believe it will introduce you to some new and useful concepts that you didn't know about before. 

The `full list of talks`_ is available.
If you haven't already registered, `what are you waiting for`_?

Party
-----

One of the biggest values of attending a conference is being in a room with so many like-minded people.
With this in mind,
we will be having a party on Monday night after the conference.
This will give you an opportunity to get to know your fellow attendees a bit better.

The party venue is near the conference venue,
so you can head over after dinner.

Student and Corporate Tickets
-----------------------------

We price the conference inexpensively so everybody is able to attend.
This year we are adding a bit more flexibility to the pricing.
We know students have very little money,
so we are offering even cheaper tickets to them.

To cover the cost of the student tickets,
we are asking companies that are buying tickets for their employees to pay a little more.
This is *optional*,
but if your company is buying your ticket,
please consider paying a bit more to help us provide cheaper tickets to students.

Go ahead and `buy your tickets`_ now.

That's all for this announcement, but we have a couple more fun things in the works for the conference. We are counting down the days, and look forward to seeing everyone in Budapest!
